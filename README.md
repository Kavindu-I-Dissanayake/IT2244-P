## HomeWork.bat

#### Features
- Extracts the **year, month, day**, and **weekday** from the system date.
- Converts the **numeric month** into a **text representation** (e.g., `01 â†’ Jan`).
- Displays the extracted date components.
- Pauses execution to allow the user to review the output.

#### Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script (`.bat` file) in a Windows **Command Prompt**.
3. View the extracted and formatted date components.

#### Notes
- Ensure the script is run in a **Command Prompt** window.
- The date format may vary based on system regional settings.
  - The default format used in this script assumes `MM/DD/YYYY` (adjust substring positions if needed).
- The script relies on basic string manipulation and conditional checks.
